    <p>      Indian food is not just the most the delicious and exotic food but also the healthiest.
        It is probably the only kind that offers such a diverse range when it comes to vegetarian dishes.
        The ingredients used to make Indian meals are a variety of vegetables and pulses, the latter are rich in
        various vitamins and minerals such iron, potassium, magnesium and zinc while the former are a good source of
        vitamin A and C. Also every Indian dish contains a good amount of spices, herbs and condiments like for
        eg: mustard seed contains magnesium that is useful to reduce migraine pain and then there is cinnamon that can r
        educe cholesterol. All these not only add to the taste of every dish but also makes it a tasty healthy mix.
        Hence I have decided to write very healthy and Yummy recipes from my kitchen, so that I can answer to "Which
        Sabji should I make today. I will be also answering to your food related question on my website. Readers can buy some
        of our products which are authentic and daily essential in Kitchen.
